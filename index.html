            <h1>How My Slimming Tea Cost Me the Career of a Dream...
            </h1>
            <div class="subtext">
                <p>As far as I remember I always wanted to fly, to travel the world and experience different places and people.</p>

                <br>

                <p></p>Initial years of working as an air hostess were really challenging. 
                Getting used to long working hours, jet lags, and work stress was making it difficult for me to keep my focus.</p>

                <br>

                <p></p>My job routine made me a caffeineaholic who couldn't function without a cup of tea every hour.</p>

                <br>

                <p></p>Also, my sluggish metabolism started giving me a hard time keeping my weight 
                under check. I started gaining pounds. To curb my appetite, I ended up drinking extra cups of tea.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The day I came across a job opening. XXX Air Lines was looking for air hostesses and I desperately wanted to 
                be part of the best airline in the US. </p>

                <br>

               <p> The interviewer panel was studying and discussing my resume when I entered the room. I could clearly see that 
                appreciation in their eyes while walking towards them.</p>

                <br>

               <p> As I approached the table, I confidently greeted everyone with a big smile. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Everything changed at that moment… </p>

                <br>
                <p>… an indication of repulsion appeared on their faces.</p>

                <br>

                <p>After interviewing about my experience, passions, and aspirations, 
                one of the interviewers said at the end <i>"no doubt you are talented and your qualification and 
                experience perfectly aligns with our requirements, but in addition to all these qualities, this post requires 
                a svelte lady with a beaming smile." </i> </p>

                <br>

                <p>INSTANTLY something broke inside me. My confidence vanished in the air and my dream of joining xxx Air 
                Lines turned into a nightmare. </p>

                <br>
                
                <p>I started hating myself. This rejection destroyed my peace of mind and confidence big time. My weight, my 
                stained teeth were casting a dark shadow on my career.

                <br>

                <p> knew my slow metabolism was to be blamed. I knew tea was the culprit to tarnish my smile but letting 
                go of tea wasn't possible. I went for teeth whitening but it lasted less than expected. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Joined a gym and hired a professional trainer but even after 6 months of untiring effort, that dream hourglass 
                body was still a dream. The number of teacups a day was multiplying.</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>Now, I lost all hopes and motivation to become slim and smart enough with a sparkling smile. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Then a friend of mine told me about a self-assessment quiz that changed my life!</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>Ever since taking the quiz and following the advice I got afterward, my journey towards achieving a sexy, 
                smart, and energetic body started, and that too with whitening my teeth. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Yes, a 2-in-1 savior solution for me!</p>

                <br>

                <p>I started to see a tremendous improvement in my energy level along with a reduction in my weight. With 
                every cup of tea my teeth were becoming whiter and shiner. Now I can easily fit in my wardrobe from a decade
                ago and confidently flaunt a big smile in public! 

                <br>

                <p>And it all started with that one 90-second quiz.</p>
